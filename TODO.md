# TODO

## Phase 3 necessities:

### Flask app:

- DB bootstrap file
- Routes for Phase 2 wireframes + other routes (total > 8)
- Remove all unnecessary routes

### AppSmith app:
- 4+ pages (screens) that connect to Flask API
- At least one page must insert/update data in the DB
    - this can be adding menu items?
- Remainder can be simple data views using GET requests

## Final deliverables:
- 3-5 minute video pitch of the product, including an AppSmith demo
    - brief intro of team
    - application "elevator pitch"
    - review of created routes
    - demo of AppSmith screens (show that data is updating in DB for POST screen)
- GitHub repo w/ all necessary code and infrastructure; include top-level updated README.md 
- UI implemented in AppSmith server
